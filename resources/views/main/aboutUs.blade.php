<h2 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 15px;">About the Origamiclub Website</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Origamiclub is a high quality website teaching how to make origami.</p>
            <p>This website was created with the intention of bringing it’s readers easy to follow, clear instructions on how to make origami.</p>
            <p>Origamiclub features an easy to navigate category menu to the left (top menu on mobile). This makes it easy to find the origami model you wish to make. We have also added a search box above the categories. Simply click the search box, enter your text and tap your return key.</p>
            <p>It’s also easy to determine the difficulty level of the origami project when selecting a model and also on each tutorials first page.</p>
            <p>Each origami model has a difficulty rating of beginner, easy, intermediate or advanced. You’ll also sometimes see the ratings “easy-intermediate” or “intermediate-advanced” – these represent the models in between difficulty levels.</p>
            <p>Origamiclub has unique features that make navigating and saving tutorials easy. You can add tutorials to a personal favourites list, copy the url of the tutorial as well as share the tutorial on social media.</p>
            <p>We make sure to photograph each step, so as not to miss any out. You will not find many arrows or lines in our step by step tutorials. This is because we have found these to be more confusing than simple “before and after” style instructions. Each step also has a written instruction to the right (or underneath on smaller screens).</p>
            <p>Each photo can also be clicked in order to enlarge it if you need to. Each step in a tutorial also has its own link, simply click on the little paperclip icon on the individual photo to copy the link to your clipboard. Then, you can paste the link in a new tab, email or wherever you like.</p>
            <p>Some models have a video tutorial included at the end, and each tutorial will indicate if the video is available on the first page of the tutorial.</p>
            <p>Don’t forget to bookmark any tutorials you wish to complete later <b>by holding down your CTRL (command on Mac) and tapping D</b>.</p>
            <p>It’s really nice to see your results! Why not take a photo of your finished model, you can leave a comment and upload it at the end of each tutorial. Alternatively, tag @origamidotguide on instagram or facebook.</p>
            <p>We have taken a lot of time creating the tutorials on Origami.guide. We very much hope that you enjoy them!</p>
